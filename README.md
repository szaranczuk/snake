# Simple snake game made in C++17 with STL
Still in development  

### build deps:
 - `gcc`
 - `cmake`


### build proces:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

todo:  
- refactorize all cpp files  
- make better snake grow mechanism (growing when the apple comes to end of tail)  
- make better snake move mechanism (real-time moving without clicking enter)  

Project inspired by <a href = "https://github.com/gizlu/">gizlu</a>/<a href = "https://github.com/gizlu/snake">snake</a>. But just inspired, not copied (at least not all). I've took only random number generator, most of main.cpp and README because of same installation processes. Code is similar, but that's very simple game and almost all of these are made accidently.
